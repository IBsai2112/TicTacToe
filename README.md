Tic Tac Toe Game – React.js

This project is a Tic Tac Toe game built using React.js. It is based on the official React tutorial but implemented using functional components and the useState Hook to manage the game’s state. The focus of this project is to understand how React handles user interaction, state updates, and component-based design in a practical way.

The application was created using Create React App, which provides a ready-to-use setup for developing and running React applications without complex configuration.

How to Run the Project

After navigating to the project folder, you can use the following commands:

npm start

This command runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000
 in your browser to see the game.

The page will automatically refresh whenever you make changes to the code, and any errors or warnings will appear in the console.

npm test

Starts the test runner in watch mode, allowing you to run tests continuously while developing the application.

npm run build

Generates a production-ready version of the app inside the build folder.
The build is optimized for better performance, minified for smaller file sizes, and ready to be deployed.

npm run eject

⚠️ Use with caution

Ejecting gives you full control over the configuration files such as Webpack and Babel. However, this step cannot be undone and is usually not required for small or medium-sized projects.
